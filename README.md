# Node.js-Express---Quote-Exercise

##Quote API

In this project, you’ll be building a small Express.js web API to store and serve different quotes about computers, coding, and technology.

You’ve been given some starter code in the form of a front-end site and some Express.js boilerplate. You’ll use this to build several route handlers to serve up interesting quotes. As you build out your app, test out the functionality either using our front-end or with a tool like Postman. Make sure to re-run node server.js as you make changes to the server, and visit localhost:4001 in the browser to interact with the front-end.

In server.js, we’ve provided you with some imported helper functions and data:

    A quotes array with some pre-populated quotes about technology. Each quote in the array has a person and quote property. You can use our array or write your own, but make sure to have at least the person and quote properties, as the front-end that we’ve provided expects each quote to have them.
    The getRandomElement() function, which takes an array and returns a random element from that array.
